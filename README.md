# `The Pokedex Challenge with PHP`
****
****
## `Our learning objectives`
- Starting with PHP `(entering a new world)`
  * We should be able to write a simple condition and a simple loop
  * Learn how to access external resources (API)
- Know where to search for PHP documentation
- Find out how much easier it is to learn a second programming language

## `The Mission`
Today we are re-creating the Pok√©dex we made with JavaScript, only this time it is obvious we will be using PHP instead of JS.

So let's take a deep breath and see how we can tackle this. Let's do this!

## `Some Tips`
We got a few links to some functions that will help us get on our way.

- [file_get_contents()](http://php.net/file_get_contents)
- [json_decode()](http://php.net/json_decode)
- [var_dump() - to help you debug](http://php.net/var_dump) - `console.log family?!`

Be careful to get an `array`, not an `object`, back from **_json_decode()_**. Read the documentation on how to do this.
You could do it with `objects`, but it will be more difficult.

## `How to search for PHP documentation`
PHP has very good documentation available on www.php.net. There is a nice trick you can use to quickly get documentation on any php function. Just type in the browser php.net/FUNCTION_NAME and you will arrive at the correct documentation page. Also spend some time clicking on the "See also" section at the bottom of each page, this will quickly get you a good overview of what is possible with PHP.

## `PHP the right way`
Another interesting read is http://phptherightway.com. This is not so much documentation over each separate function, but gives you more an overview of best practices and how different components work together.
